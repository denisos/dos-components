# dos-components
Custom component library I built using tech below. Deployed to npm so can be installed and used in your app.

In most cases its better to theme & customize a pre-built such as material design than build your own from scratch (because it's a lot of effort). But I wanted to use this as a learning opportunity and build out my own component library and reuse in my apps.

Technology used
* react
* typescript
* styled-components
* storybook
* jest
* rollup - module bundler
